# Kaggle-ML-Exercise-Notebooks
This repository contains notebooks in which I have implementated ML Kaggle Exercises for academic and self-learning purposes. In my notebooks, I have implemented some basic processes involved in ML Data Processing like How to take care of Missing Values, Handling Categorical Variables, and operations like'Mapping', 'Grouping', 'Sorting',  'Renaming and Combining' etc. on Kaggle datasets.
